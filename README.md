🏥 Hospital Patients Data Analysis

This project analyzes patient data from an internal medicine department using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).
The dataset is stored in diabetes.xlsx and includes features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes measurements.

⚡ Features

Reads hospital data from an Excel file.

Performs basic statistical analysis:

Average Age

Average Blood Pressure

Average Cholesterol

Average Diabetes-M

Visualizes the data with charts:

Histogram of Age distribution

Boxplot of Blood Pressure

Boxplot of Cholesterol

Histogram of Diabetes-M distribution

📂 Example Output

Printed results:

Average Age: 54.3  
Average Blood Pressure: 128.5  
Average Cholesterol: 189.2  
Average Diabetes-M: 6.4  


Charts generated:

Histogram of Age → shows frequency of patients by age groups.

Boxplot of Blood Pressure → shows median, quartiles, and outliers.

Boxplot of Cholesterol → shows cholesterol variation among patients.

Histogram of Diabetes-M → shows distribution of diabetes measurements.

🔧 Requirements

Python 3.8+

Libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl

▶️ Run the diabetes.py or diabetes1.ipynb
